%%% Notes! This is because the atsign-INBOOK citation type specifies EITHER

%%% bibtex style (and presumably this applies to other styles too), bibtex
%%% ignores the editor information if author information exists in an

%%% and in the absence of an editor I believe most bibtex styles will just
%%% ommit the editor from the reference - the chapter information will not
%%% end up in the in-text citation as you suggest it should be but at least
%%% there is a place to put the editor if necessary.

  abstract  = {Despite the advent of numerous Internet-of-Things (IoT) applications, recent research demonstrates potential side-channel vulnerabilities exploiting sensors which are used for event and environment monitoring. In this paper, we propose a new side-channel attack, where a network of distributed non-acoustic sensors can be exploited by an attacker to launch an eavesdropping attack by reconstructing intelligible speech signals. Specifically, we present PitchIn to demonstrate the feasibility of speech reconstruction from non-acoustic sensor data collected offline across networked devices. Unlike speech reconstruction which requires a high sampling frequency (e.g., > 5 KHz), typical applications using non-acoustic sensors do not rely on richly sampled data, presenting a challenge to the speech reconstruction attack. Hence, PitchIn leverages a distributed form of Time Interleaved Analog-Digital-Conversion (TIADC) to approximate a high sampling frequency, while maintaining low per-node sampling frequency. We demonstrate how distributed TI-ADC can be used to achieve intelligibility by processing an interleaved signal composed of different sensors across networked devices. We implement PitchIn and evaluate reconstructed speech signal intelligibility via user studies. PitchIn has word recognition accuracy as high as 79\%. Though some additional work is required to improve accuracy, our results suggest that eavesdropping using a fusion of non-acoustic sensors is a real and practical threat.},

  abstract  = {In this paper, we build a speech privacy attack that exploits speech reverberations from a smartphone's inbuilt loudspeaker captured via a zero-permission motion sensor (accelerometer). We design our attack Spearphone, and demonstrate that speech reverberations from inbuilt loudspeakers, at an appropriate loudness, can impact the accelerometer, leaking sensitive information about the speech. In particular, we show that by exploiting the affected accelerometer readings and carefully selecting feature sets along with off-the-shelf machine learning techniques, Spearphone can perform gender classification (accuracy over 90\%) and speaker identification (accuracy over 80\%) for the audio/video playback on the smartphone for our recorded dataset. We use lightweight classifiers and an off-the-shelf machine learning tool so that the attacking effort is minimized, making our attack practical. Our results with testing the attack on a voice call and voice assistant response were also encouraging, showcasing the impact of the proposed attack. In addition, we perform speech recognition and speech reconstruction to extract more information about the eavesdropped speech to an extent. Our work brings to light a fundamental design vulnerability in many currently-deployed smartphones, which may put people's speech privacy at risk while using the smartphone in the loudspeaker mode during phone calls, media playback or voice assistant interactions.},

  abstract   = {This paper presents iSpyU, a system that shows the feasibility of recognition of natural speech content played on a phone during conference calls (Skype, Zoom, etc) using a fusion of motion sensors such as accelerometer and gyroscope. While microphones require permissions from the user to be accessible by an app developer, the motion sensors are zero-permission sensors, thus accessible by a developer without alerting the user. This allows a malicious app to potentially eavesdrop on sensitive speech content played by the user's phone. In designing the attack, iSpyU tackles a number of technical challenges including: (i) Low sampling rate of motion sensors (500 Hz in comparison to 44 kHz for a microphone). (ii) Lack of availability of large-scale training datasets to train models for Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) with motion sensors. iSpyU systematically addresses these challenges by a combination of techniques in synthetic training data generation, ASR modeling, and domain adaptation. Extensive measurement studies on modern smartphones show a word level accuracy of 53.3 - 59.9\% over a dictionary of 2000-10000 words, and a character level accuracy of 70.0 - 74.8\%. We believe such levels of accuracy poses a significant threat when viewed from a privacy perspective.},

  abstract  = {Voice control has emerged as a popular method for interacting with smart-devices such as smartphones, smartwatches etc. Popular voice control applications like Siri and Google Now are already used by a large number of smartphone and tablet users. A major challenge in designing a voice control application is that it requires continuous monitoring of user?s voice input through the microphone. Such applications utilize hotwords such as "Okay Google" or "Hi Galaxy" allowing them to distinguish user?s voice command and her other conversations. A voice control application has to continuously listen for hotwords which significantly increases the energy consumption of the smart-devices.To address this energy efficiency problem of voice control, we present AccelWord in this paper. AccelWord is based on the empirical evidence that accelerometer sensors found in today?s mobile devices are sensitive to user?s voice. We also demonstrate that the effect of user?s voice on accelerometer data is rich enough so that it can be used to detect the hotwords spoken by the user. To achieve the goal of low energy cost but high detection accuracy, we combat multiple challenges, e.g. how to extract unique signatures of user?s speaking hotwords only from accelerometer data and how to reduce the interference caused by user?s mobility.We finally implement AccelWord as a standalone application running on Android devices. Comprehensive tests show AccelWord has hotword detection accuracy of 85\% in static scenarios and 80\% in mobile scenarios. Compared to the microphone based hotword detection applications such as Google Now and Samsung S Voice, AccelWord is 2 times more energy efficient while achieving the accuracy of 98\% and 92\% in static and mobile scenarios respectively.},

  abstract  = {Considering the threat from on-board eavesdropping with smartphone motion sensors, Android 12 has limited the maximum sampling rate of motion sensors to 200Hz for zero-privilege access to prevent potential wiretapping. Unfortunately, there have been some attacks targeting 200Hz, making it not a safe sampling rate any more. Smartphone manufacturers may further reduce the maximum sampling rate of the accelerometer in response to this privacy concern. It can be expected that, the maximum sampling rate will gradually decrease to a very low level, as the battle between manufacturers and adversaries continues. Existing on-board eavesdropping approaches, utilizing spectral features, cannot provide acceptable accuracy at very low sampling rates, not even at 50Hz.Therefore, this paper explores the feasibility of using the on-board accelerometer for privacy breaking with an extremely-low sampling rate, specifically, 5Hz. 5Hz is a minimum sampling rate to meet normal use, otherwise the applications can only choose to work without the accelerometer. Since the lowest fundamental frequency for humans is around 85Hz, such a low sampling rate poses a significant challenge for sound recognition. According to Nyquist's law, it seems impossible to capture 85Hz with the sampling rate of 5Hz. Fortunately, we observe that the rhythm features, including pause rhythm and intensity rhythm, of accelerometer data are relatively stable at various sampling rates. On this basis, we propose an eavesdropping approach with the accelerometer at an extremely-low sampling rate. Introducing the rhythm features, we achieve an accuracy of 95.09\% at 50Hz and 78.66\% at 5Hz for scene recognition. The accuracy is 90.60\% at 50Hz and 47\% at 5Hz for Chinese digits recognition, plus 96.63\% at 50Hz and 58.67\% at 5Hz for popular Chinese cities recognition. Furthermore, we achieve determination for typical places like bar, metro, bus, car, and quiet room, by analyzing the vibration of surroundings, with an average accuracy of 91.28\%. Combining place determination with eavesdropping, our approach poses a serious threat to personal privacy. Since 5Hz is generally used for screen orientation detection, our attack can hide in any kind of application, not just in game or sport applications. We also suggest some countermeasures.},

  abstract   = {The built-in loudspeakers of mobile devices (e.g., smartphones, smartwatches, and tablets) play significant roles in human-machine interaction, such as playing music, making phone calls, and enabling voice-based interaction. Prior studies have pointed out that it is feasible to eavesdrop on the speaker via motion sensors, but whether it is possible to synthesize speech from non-acoustic signals with sub-Nyquist sampling frequency has not been studied. In this paper, we present an end-to-end model to reconstruct the acoustic waveforms that are playing on the loudspeaker through the vibration captured by the built-in accelerometer. Specifically, we present an end-to-end speech synthesis framework dubbed AccMyrinx to eavesdrop on the speaker using the built-in low-resolution accelerometer of mobile devices. AccMyrinx takes advantage of the coexistence of an accelerometer with the loudspeaker on the same motherboard and compromises the loudspeaker by the solid-borne vibrations captured by the accelerometer. Low-resolution vibration signals are fed to a wavelet-based MelGAN to generate intelligible acoustic waveforms. We conducted extensive experiments on a large-scale dataset created based on audio clips downloaded from Voice of America (VOA). The experimental results show that AccMyrinx is capable of reconstructing intelligible acoustic signals that are playing on the loudspeaker with a smoothed word error rate (SWER) of 42.67\%. The quality of synthesized speeches could be severely affected by several factors including gender, speech rate, and volume.},

  abstract   = {Motion sensors in modern smartphones have been exploited for audio eavesdropping in loudspeaker mode due to their sensitivity to vibrations. In this paper, we further move one step forward to explore the feasibility of using built-in accelerometer to eavesdrop on the telephone conversation of caller/callee who takes the phone against cheek-ear and design our attack Vibphone. The inspiration behind Vibphone is that the speech-induced vibrations (SIV) can be transmitted through the physical contact of phone-cheek to accelerometer with the traces of voice content. To this end, Vibphone faces three main challenges: i) Accurately detecting SIV signals from miscellaneous disturbance; ii) Combating the impact of device diversity to work with a variety of attack scenarios; and iii) Enhancing feature-agnostic recognition model to generalize to newly issued devices and reduce training overhead. To address these challenges, we first conduct an in-depth investigation on SIV features to figure out the root cause of device diversity impacts and identify a set of critical features that are highly relevant to the voice content retained in SIV signals and independent of specific devices. On top of these pivotal observations, we propose a combo method that is the integration of extracted critical features and deep neural network to recognize speech information from the spectrogram representation of acceleration signals. We implement the attack using commodity smartphones and the results show it is highly effective. Our work brings to light a fundamental design vulnerability in the vast majority of currently deployed smartphones, which may put people's speech privacy at risk during phone calls. We also propose a practical and effective defense solution. We validate that it is feasible to prevent audio eavesdropping by using random variation of sampling rate.},

Existing studies demonstrate the feasibility of applying learning-based solutions on built-in sensor measurements to recover voices. However, due to the privacy concerns, large-scale voices-sensor measurements samples for model training are not publicly available, leading to significant efforts in data collection for such an attack. In this paper, we propose a training-free and universal eavesdropping attack on built-in speakers, VoiceListener, which releases the data collection efforts and is able to adapt to various voices, platforms, and domains. In particular, VoiceListener develops an aliasing-corrected super resolution mechanism, including an aliasing-based pitch estimation and an aliasing-corrected voice recovering, to convert the undersampled narrow-band sensor measurements to wide-band voices. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed VoiceListener could accurately recover the voices from undersampled sensor measurements and is robust to different voices, platforms and domains, realizing the universal eavesdropping attack.},

LidarPhone is able to detect the minute vibrations induced on objects that are near audio sources, and extract meaningful signals from inherently noisy raw lidar returns. We evaluate a realistic scenario for potential victims: recovering privacy-sensitive digits (e.g., credit card numbers, social security numbers) emitted by computer speakers during teleconferencing calls. We implement LidarPhone on a Xiaomi Roborock vacuum cleaning robot and perform a comprehensive series of real-world experiments to determine its performance.

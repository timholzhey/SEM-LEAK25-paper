  % Topic + Relevance
  In recent years, numerous research papers have shown that air pressure waves produced by human speech or other sounds can induce vibrations into an array of non-acoustic sensors (e.g. motions sensors) or into externally measured objects (e.g. laser-based vibrometer) skewing sensor readings in a reversable manner, effectively turning them into undisclosed microphones.
  This allows for eavesdropping on private speech by maliciously altered devices and therefore posing a real threat to privacy when exploited.
  
  % Objective of this paper
  This work will examine and compare different types of acoustic vibration-based side channel attacks employed on common IoT and Smart devices to recover speech or infer privacy-sensitive information about the speaker like their identity, political views or gender.
  We explore the steps taken to take control of the targeted device, gather the necessary data, and perform signal processing and machine learning techniques to extract audible information from the sensor readings.
  The overview established over the attacks then allows for a comprehensive feasability study for the respective attack methods and complexity required to perform such attacks in a real world scenario. 
  We discuss possible countermeasures to mitigate the risk of such attacks and provide an outlook on future research directions in the field.

\section{Introduction}
While the IoT market is on the rise and still growing exponentially, projected to exceed USD 4 trillion by 2032 \cite{FortuneBusinessInsights2024}, this opens up a new attack vector for adversaries to exploit in addition to traditional software vulnerabilities in computers.
Latest surveys show that the American households had on average 21 connected devices \cite{DeloitteConnectedConsumer2023}, a relevant part of which are IoT and Smart Home devices.
IoT devices are often equipped with a variety of sensors to interface with their physical environment, such as accelerometers, gyroscopes, microphones, and cameras.
Many of these sensors can also be found in modern smartphones, which are carried around by most people\footnote{Surveys from 2024 suggest that 91 \% of Americans own a smartphone}. Mobile operating systems provide zero-permission access to sensor data from the built-in accelerometer and gyroscope, therefore have been the subject of the majority of research done in this field.
The findings from vulnerabilities found in smartphones can be projected onto IoT and Smart devices with similar sensors that do not have a primary function of audio recording i.e. do not have a built-in microphone ("non-sensing").
To execute a vibration-based eavesdropping attack, most of the previous papers took the approuch to exploited MEMS\footnote{Abbr. Micro-electromechanical systems \cite{PewResearchMobileFactSheet2024}} motion sensors (accelerometers, gyroscopes and magnetometers) commonly found in smartphones and many smart devices including smartwatches, fitness trackers, gaming controllers, etc.
Some of the more experimental approaches have also shown that other sensors like Lidar scanners in vacuum cleaners, the position error signal of write heads in hard drives or electro-optical sensors directed at ceiling lights can be exploited for similar attacks.

\textbf{CONTRIBUTION}\\
Altough parts of the available research material in this field is investigating keystroke recovery attacks \cite{Touchtone2023}\cite{TouchLogger2011}\cite{TapLogger2012} or is using sophisticated external setups (e.g. RFID-Tags \cite{RFMic2023}, millimeter-waves \cite{MMMic2022}, WiFi radio \cite{ART2015}), we limit the scope of this paper to on-device vibration-based speech and general sound recovery attacks.
This includes attacks in theory possible without any modified or additional hardware assuming a compromised device or malicious software.
This work aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the current state of research in the field of vibration-based eavesdropping attacks on non-sensing devices.
We highlight notable research papers and their findings, compare the different attack methods and achieved results, and discuss the feasibility of such attacks in real-world scenarios.

\section{Background}
\subsection{Vibration-based Eavesdropping Attacks}
Sound created by a human speaking or any other sound can be characterized as spatially and temporally propagating changes in air pressure in the audible frequency range (20 Hz - 20 kHz).
Similarly to how sound waves induce vibrations into our eardrums to let us perceive sound, they can also couple vibrations into all other objects they encounter, more so into objects that are resonant at the frequency of the sound.
In a typical microphone, an oscillating diaphragm is used to convert these vibrations into an electrical signal i.e. a change in voltage by varying the capacitance of a capacitor (condenser microphone) or by inducing a current into a coil (dynamic microphone).
Even if unintended, the same phenomenon can be used to turn any other sensing electrical component into a microphone if it has a moving part capable of influencing the electrical properties of the component directly (e.g. MEMS, write head of a hard drive) or observing the movement of another object (e.g. laser vibrometer, Lidar scanner, camera).
